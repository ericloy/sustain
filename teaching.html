			<i class="fa fa-cog"></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;<strong>The Contemporary Novel: Experiments in Form</strong> -- This course focuses on popular authors at the forefront of literary experimentation, examining the ways in which their novels push material design and narrative structure to the conceptual limit of print fiction. In examining these new novels, our fundamental consideration will concern how such texts reshape the book as a media format of the present and reinvigorate the novel as a literary form of the future.
