        <h5>Bio:</h5>

        <p>My name is Eric Loy, and I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of English at the University of Rochester. I'm also an instructor for the <a href="http://writing.rochester.edu">Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program</a> at UR, as well as Project Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org">William Blake Archive</a>. Formerly, I was a Fellow in the <a href="http://humanities.lib.rochester.edu/mellondh/">Andrew W. Mellon Graduate Program in the Digital Humanities.</a></p>

        <p>Motivated by questions of form and format in contemporary literature, I am currently preparing a dissertation with the working title "The New Textual Tradition: Narrative and Material Design in Contemporary Fiction" (Advisors: Jeffrey Tucker and Morris Eaves).</p>

        <p>Current publications include a study of Edenic motif and narrative in Cormac McCarthy’s <em>Child of God</em> (<a href="http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_CormacMcCarthy.html">Cormac McCarthy Journal</a>, Vol. 12), and a co-written progress report on <a href="http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.728/">prototyping an experimental electronic edition</a> of William Blake’s The Four Zoas manuscript. For a list of recent and forthcoming presentations, please see C.V.</p>

        <p>I have previously taught courses in English Composition at Creighton University, where I also served as a research assistant for <a href="http://centerforhenryjamesstudies.weebly.com">The Complete Letters of Henry James</a> (Eds. Greg W. Zacharias and Michael Anesko).</p>
