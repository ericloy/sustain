        <h5>Bio:</h5>

        <p>Hello, World! My name is Eric Loy, and I'm currently a PhD Candidate in the Department of English at the University of Rochester. At UR, I have taught classes in the <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/eng/">Department of English</a>, the <a href="http://writing.rochester.edu" target="_blank">Writing, Speaking, and Argument Program</a>, and for <a href="https://www.sas.rochester.edu/dms/">Digital Media Studies</a>. I currently serve as Project Coordinator for the <a href="http://www.blakearchive.org" target="_blank">William Blake Archive</a>. Formerly, I was a Fellow in the <a href="http://humanities.lib.rochester.edu/mellondh/" target="_blank">Andrew W. Mellon Graduate Program in the Digital Humanities.</a> For the 2019-2020 academic year, I am a Dudley Doust Writing Associate Fellow.</p>

        <p>Motivated by questions of form and format in contemporary literature, I am currently preparing a dissertation with the working title <i>Material Worlds: Narrative and Design in Contemporary Fiction</i>, Advisors Jeffrey Tucker and Morris Eaves.</p>

        <p>Current publications include a study of Edenic motif and narrative in Cormac McCarthy’s <em>Child of God</em> (<a href="http://www.psupress.org/journals/jnls_CormacMcCarthy.html" target="_blank"><i>Cormac McCarthy Journal</i></a>, Vol. 12), and a co-written progress report on <a href="http://www.19.bbk.ac.uk/articles/10.16995/ntn.728/" target="_blank">prototyping an experimental electronic edition</a> of William Blake’s <i>VALA, or, the Four Zoas</i> manuscript. I recently reviewed Amaranth's Borsuk's <i>The Book</i> (MIT 2018) for <a href="https://doi.org/10.14434/textual.v12i1.27158" target="_blank"><i>Textual Cultures</i></a>. For a list of recent and upcoming presentations, please visit the <a href="talks.html">Talks</a> page.</p>

        <p>I have previously taught courses in English Composition at Creighton University, where I also served as a research assistant for <a href="http://centerforhenryjamesstudies.weebly.com" target="_blank">The Complete Letters of Henry James</a> (Eds. Greg W. Zacharias and Michael Anesko). For current and recent courses taught at the University of Rochester, please visit the <a href="teaching.html">Teaching</a> page.</p> 
        
        <p>I am, in fact, a <a href="http://www.rochestercurling.org" target="_blank">curler</a>.</p>
