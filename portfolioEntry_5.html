        <p>In spring 2016 I served as Teaching Assistant for <a href="http://www.rochester.edu/college/eng/people/faculty/burges_joel/index.html" target="_blank">Joel Burges</a>'s graduate seminar <em>Marxism and Forms</em>. Although the seminar did not have an explicit digital component, our idea was that we could use DH's contemporary interrogation of data and visual information as a guide for reading the Marxist tradition.</p> 
        
        <p>As it turns out, the Marxist tradition is full of writers using charts, graphs, and data to support their arguments. Our challenge to the class: make some of your own!</p>
